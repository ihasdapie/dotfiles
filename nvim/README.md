# Brian's Neovim Config

This is an opinionated neovim development & general use setup. Changes can be breaking, though I will try my best to avoid it.
Keybinds are largely similar to that of doom emacs; this is because I use org mode for notes, planning, and (soon!) my website.



## Why not use emacs for everything?
Vim is faster. Even with emacs 28 I get lagginess and choppiness I don't experience in vim. Emacs does have a great set of features, which I do like to use. A lot of the plugins are more mature as well; e.g. Magit. However the responsiveness just isn't quite there. For that reason, the editing experience is compromised --> therefore I stick with neovim.
